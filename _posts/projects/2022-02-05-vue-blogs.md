#### Technologies

This site is built with Nuxt which applies some standardization to vue. The site is self is hosted on Amplify. The styling is all done with Vuetify. This is all at the time of this writiing, and it is possible that I could add other features to the site which would expand the tech. I might add a feature eventually that would need a backend/database, and I will use Lambdas and DynamoDB most likely if I do add that.

The site itself currently has a few games that are just created in Vue (tic-tac-toe/trivia..etc). I also started moving any new blogs I write to that site. Nuxt is a common tech for blog sites and it is pretty neat how it is setup. 

I chose amplify for the tech because I don't know what features I might add to the site, and amplify makes it really flexible to add a lot of new stuff if I want to in the future. 

If interested, feel free to checkout the [hosted site](https://main.duar4efa9xb.amplifyapp.com/) and the repo!
