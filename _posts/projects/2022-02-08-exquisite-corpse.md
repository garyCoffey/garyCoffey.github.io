#### Exquisite Corpse

This project was a group effort completed at the end of my time in a coding bootcamp. The [project is hosted](https://exquisite-corpse-cp.herokuapp.com/), but at the time of this writing it seems like some of the pages are currently broken. On the brightside, you can see the supposed to be easter egg of what happens when a 500 internal server error occurs (also recommend going to `/gibberish` to see the 404).

#### Technologies

This project has a Rails backend, React frontend, and hosting is on Heroku. It also uses some 3rd part packages for the drawing features. 

....(will add more soon)
