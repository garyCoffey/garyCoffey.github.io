### Language

This problem was solve in Ruby.

### Description

This was a 25 day challenge of coding problems. I am starting a bit late but will be trying to catch up. The entry file will run the results from each fo the days. Each day will have a ReadMe describing the challenge for that day.


### Interactive Terminal

I have the repo of this algorithm linked to an interactive repl. If you would like to try the code out yourself feel free to go to the repl and give it a shot. It should by default run the test cases I have written and print in the terminal below .
